# xAI_Check_Yourself
Prompt Assessment Tool for Hallucination Risks -or-  Check yourself before you wreck yourself.  

## How to use
- Designed for Grok 4 Expert mode
- Start a empty project - name it (ex. CheckYourself)
  - Copy the instructions in Grok4_Project_Instructions.md and paste them into the instructions section of the project
  - Prefered mode - Expert
  - Save
- Click on the project name under projects in the left side panel to open a new chat in the project
- Enter the prompt to be evaluated and submit
- Grok 4 will review and discuss your prompt for various risks and refactor the prompt to emilinate them as needed.
- Use that refactored prompt for (ideally) better results.  

## Why it works
Hallucinations are primarily caused by inadvertent bias in prompts, as well as asking the model to do something it's not good at.  These instructions get the model to check for the most common issues and minimize the impact of them in your prompts.
